## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich Red-Brown (#8B4513) to reflect the warmth and richness of home-style cooking.
- Background color: Soft Beige (#F5F5DC), offering a neutral and inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Golden Yellow (#FFC82B) used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and highlights, to evoke feelings of appetizing food and premium service.
- Use warm, earthy tones inspired by both flags and cultures: Deep reds, golds, forest greens, black, and white. Zimbabwean basket-weave patterns or Ndebele geometric accents. South African flag hints in subtle UI elements (buttons, hover effects)
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable feel in body text.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel to headlines; pairs well with PT Sans for body text.
- Use clean fonts with optional accent fonts that evoke traditional African design for headings (e.g., “Ubuntu” or “Raleway” for headers)
- Use minimalist, line-style icons related to food and events, in the golden yellow accent color.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout, making generous use of whitespace, with a focus on high-quality food photography. Add a split collage-style background showing Zimbabwean village cooking scene or market and a South African braai or Sunday lunch event. Subtle textured background inspired by woven fabric, beadwork, or tribal art
